Open this file to view the assignment instructions and follow the embedded directions.\n\n4. **Submission Instructions**  \n   After completing the case, render your file to create an MS Word document (.docx). Submit this document to the Canvas Dropbox\n\n## Assignment Tasks\n\n### Part 1. Basic Commands\n\nUsing R, perform the following calculations. Store each result in a variable as indicated:\n\n1. **Addition**  \n   - Calculate the sum of 2 and 3.  \n   - Store your result in a variable named `a`.\n\n2. **Subtraction**  \n   - Calculate the difference between 5 and 8.  \n   - Store your result in a variable named `b`.\n\n3. **Multiplication**  \n   - Calculate the product of 3 and 5.  \n   - Store your result in a variable named `c`.\n\n4. **Square Root**  \n   - Use the `sqrt()` function to compute the square root of 4.  \n   - Store your result in a variable named `d`.\n\n### Part 2. Logical Tests\n\nAssume the following variable assignments in R:\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\na <- 5\nb <- 2\nc <- 5\nd <- \"five\"\ne <- \"two\"\nf <- \"Two\"\ng <- TRUE\n```\n:::\n\n\n\nEvaluate the following true/false statements using R logical operators and comparisons (Hint: Use R to answer the question. I know you can evaluate the statements.):\n\n1. Is `a` equal to `d`?\n2. Is it true that `a` equals `b + 3` **and** `a` equals `c`?\n3. Is `e` equal to `f`?\n4. Is it true that `a` equals `b + 3` **or** `a` equals `c`?\n5. Is `d` equal to `\"five\"`?\n6. Is `a` not equal to `c`?\n7. Is it true that `a` is less than 10 **or** `a` is greater than or equal to 5?\n8. Is `g` false?\n\n\n**Formatting Instructions:**\n\n- **Nicely Format Your Results:** Use Quarto or RMarkdown to clearly present your code and results.\n- **Render to MS Word:** Once your work is complete, render your file to produce an MS Word (.docx) document.\n- **Submission:** Upload the rendered document to the Canvas Dropbox.\n",
