In this assignment, you will practice using **R**, **RStudio Cloud** (hosted on Posit Cloud), and **Quarto** or **RMarkdown** to complete a series of tasks and produce a well-formatted document.

## Getting Started

1. **Join the Class Workspace**  
   If you have not joined the class workspace yet, please use the following link:  
   [Join Class Workspace](https://posit.cloud/spaces/605675/join?access_code=Js3OPYFsmb02-lu9ANwDVyD99JWafdiOTG66yKwE){target="_blank"}

2. **Access the RStudio Cloud Project**  
   Once you have joined the workspace, access the RStudio Cloud Project using this link:  
   [Access the Project](https://posit.cloud/spaces/605675/content/9686609){target="_blank"}

3. **Open the Assignment File**  
   Within the project, locate the Quarto or RMarkdown file named `CaseXX.qmd` or `CaseXX.Rmd` (where “XX” corresponds to the current case number). Open this file to view the assignment instructions and follow the embedded directions.

4. **Submission Instructions**  
   After completing the case, render your file to create an MS Word document (.docx). Submit this document to the Canvas Dropbox

## Assignment Tasks

### Part 1. Basic Commands

Using R, perform the following calculations. Store each result in a variable as indicated:

1. **Addition**  
   - Calculate the sum of 2 and 3.  
   - Store your result in a variable named `a`.

2. **Subtraction**  
   - Calculate the difference between 5 and 8.  
   - Store your result in a variable named `b`.

3. **Multiplication**  
   - Calculate the product of 3 and 5.  
   - Store your result in a variable named `c`.

4. **Square Root**  
   - Use the `sqrt()` function to compute the square root of 4.  
   - Store your result in a variable named `d`.

### Part 2. Logical Tests

Assume the following variable assignments in R:

```{r}
a <- 5
b <- 2
c <- 5
d <- "five"
e <- "two"
f <- "Two"
g <- TRUE
```

Evaluate the following true/false statements using R logical operators and comparisons (Hint: Use R to answer the question. I know you can evaluate the statements.):

1. Is `a` equal to `d`?
2. Is it true that `a` equals `b + 3` **and** `a` equals `c`?
3. Is `e` equal to `f`?
4. Is it true that `a` equals `b + 3` **or** `a` equals `c`?
5. Is `d` equal to `"five"`?
6. Is `a` not equal to `c`?
7. Is it true that `a` is less than 10 **or** `a` is greater than or equal to 5?
8. Is `g` false?


**Formatting Instructions:**

- **Nicely Format Your Results:** Use Quarto or RMarkdown to clearly present your code and results.
- **Render to MS Word:** Once your work is complete, render your file to produce an MS Word (.docx) document.
- **Submission:** Upload the rendered document to the Canvas Dropbox.
